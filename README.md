What our appointment scheduler app will look like

Weâ€™ll complete our project in 3 major sections:

    Building out the front-end in React and Webpack, with the help of the Material UI component library
    Wiring it up to a simple Express backend that will serve to make API calls to Twilio and to expose our Appointment objects to the front-end (in the spirit of keeping our Cosmic bucket keys out of our frontend code)
    Building the Extension in React, again using the Material UI library

But, before any of that, we need to get our Cosmic bucket ready to store and serve data.
